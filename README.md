# Object-tracking-and-counting-using-YOLOV8

This repository contains the code for an object detection, tracking and counting project using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm for object tracking. The project has been implemented using object-oriented programming principles in Python.

### Features:

* **Object detection**: The YOLOv8 algorithm has been used to detect objects in images and videos. The algorithm is known for its fast and accurate performance.
* **Object tracking**: The SORT algorithm has been used for tracking the detected objects in real-time. SORT is a simple algorithm that performs well in real-time tracking scenarios.
* **Object counting**: The project also includes a module for counting the number of objects detected in a given image or video.
* **OOP approach**: The project has been implemented using object-oriented programming principles, making it modular and easy to understand.
