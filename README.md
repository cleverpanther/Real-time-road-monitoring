# Object-tracking-and-counting-using-YOLOV8

This repository contains the code for an object detection, tracking and counting project using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm for object tracking. The project has been implemented using object-oriented programming principles in Python.

### Features:

* **Object detection**: The YOLOv8 algorithm has been used to detect objects in images and videos. The algorithm is known for its fast and accurate performance.
* **Object tracking**: The SORT algorithm has been used for tracking the detected objects in real-time. SORT is a simple algorithm that performs well in real-time tracking scenarios.
* **Object counting**: The project also includes a module for counting the number of objects detected in a given image or video.
* **OOP approach**: The project has been implemented using object-oriented programming principles, making it modular and easy to understand.

* [YOLOv8_Object_Detection_procedural.ipynb](https://github.com/mohamedamine99/Object-tracking-and-counting-using-YOLOV8/blob/main/YOLOv8_Object_Detection_procedural.ipynb) : The notebook provides code for object detection using YOLOv8, including different variants with different architectures and trade-offs between speed and accuracy. The code follows a procedural approach rather than object-oriented programming to make it simpler and easier to understand for beginners.

* [YOLOv8_Object_Detection_OOP.ipynb](https://github.com/mohamedamine99/Object-tracking-and-counting-using-YOLOV8/blob/main/YOLOv8_Object_Detection_OOP.ipynb) : This notebook provides code for object detection using YOLOv8, including different variants with different architectures and trade-offs between speed and accuracy. The code follows an object oriented approach rather than procedural programming to make it easier to understand, modify and maintain.

* [YOLOv8_Object_Counter_OOP.ipynb](https://github.com/mohamedamine99/Object-tracking-and-counting-using-YOLOV8/blob/main/YOLOv8_Object_Counter_OOP.ipynb) : This notebook provides code for object detection, tracking and counting also using different YOLOv8 variants and an object oriented approach.

* [YOLOv8_Object_Counter_OOP_v2.ipynb](https://github.com/mohamedamine99/Object-tracking-and-counting-using-YOLOV8/blob/main/YOLOv8_Object_Counter_OOP_v2.ipynb) :This notebook provides code for object detection, tracking and counting also using different YOLOv8 variants and an object oriented approach but the difference from [YOLOv8_Object_Counter_OOP.ipynb](https://github.com/mohamedamine99/Object-tracking-and-counting-using-YOLOV8/blob/main/YOLOv8_Object_Counter_OOP.ipynb) is that the classes are imported as an external script in order to avoid defining the classes inside the notebook and make it less cluttered with lines of code cluttered with lines of code.
